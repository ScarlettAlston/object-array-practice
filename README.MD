A simple project to practice manipulating arrays and objects. To see it in action, perform an `NPM INSTALL`, and then `NPM START`.

* Built using Express and Nodemon to keep server up do date
* By default, results can be checked at: `localhost:5000/arrays` and `localhost:5000/objects`
* To practice, modify the functions in `src/arrays/arrays.practice.js` and `src/objects/objects.practice.js`
