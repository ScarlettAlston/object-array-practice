A simple project to practice manipulating arrays and objects. To see it in action, perform an `NPM INSTALL`, and then `NPM START`.

To start practicing, modify the functions located at `src/arrays/arrays.practice.js` and `src/objects/objects.practice.js`.

By default, the results can be checked at `localhost:5000/arrays` and `localhost:5000/objects`, respectively.
